You need "DroidCam" app for this in your Android phone.

# How to use?
* Download DroidCam app on your Android and check IP and PORT.
* Run capture.py to access your Android's camera. App will ask your IP and PORT.


In case using same IP and PORT all the time, you can use "capture_setting.dat".
Set "ask_settings=False" to skip IP/PORT settings on the App.


# Camera Control
You can control your camera with pushing buttons on a video window.

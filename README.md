# How to use?


* Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/AiueoABC/Play_with_DroidCam.git`
* Move to the cloned directory `cd Play_with_DroidCam`
* Install requirements `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


* Download DroidCam app on your phone and check IP and PORT.
* Run capture.py to access your Android's camera. `python capture.py` 
App will ask your IP and PORT.

### Small Tip
In case of you using same IP and PORT all the time, you can use "capture_setting.dat".  
Set "ask_settings=False" to skip IP/PORT settings on the App.


# Camera Control
You can control your camera with pushing buttons on a video window.  
Save Photo button will save the frame shown in app.
